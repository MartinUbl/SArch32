\section{Introduction}

The SArch32 (StupidArch32) is a custom, experimental instruction set architecture (ISA) made for purely educational purposes. The design includes the ISA, assembly, assembler itself and emulator.

SArch32 is inspired by several existing architectures, including ARM (v6), MIPS, x86 and more.

At this moment, there is no intention to synthetize hardware conforming to this design.
